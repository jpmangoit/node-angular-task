### Angular Frontend

On the frontend, you can test the following URLs:

1. **Regular Component**
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:4200/`
   - **Description:** Renders the `regular` component, which is not loaded lazily.

2. **Lazy-Loaded Module**
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:4200/hello`
   - **Description:** Renders the `hello` page with the lazy-loaded module.

These URLs allow you to test both a component that is loaded eagerly and a module that is loaded lazily.
